    title: "Perceived Barriers for Accessing International Research Funding among Latin American Researchers"
    summary: "Researchers in Latin America face persistent structural, linguistic, and cultural barriers that limit equitable access to international research funding. Our mixed-methods study identified key obstacles, such as economic constraints, misaligned eligibility criteria, and rhetorical differences, and proposes strategies like context-sensitive training, mentorship, and inclusive funding design to address them."

    title: "Changes in Knowledge, Practices, and Perceived Importance of Open Science Following a Training Program for Latin American Researchers"
    summary: "Open Science offers a path toward more transparent and equitable research, yet Latin American researchers face cultural, structural, and institutional barriers to its adoption. This mixed-methods study found that targeted training can enhance knowledge, implementation, and perceived importance of Open Science practices, helping to reduce these obstacles."

    title: "Epistemic Justice and Open Science in Latin America and the Caribbean: The Case of MetaDocencia (“Dominique Babini” Award) [Justicia epistémica y ciencia abierta en América Latina y el Caribe. El caso de MetaDocencia (Premio “Dominique Babini”)]"
    summary: "Open science can advance epistemic justice in Latin America and the Caribbean only when it is context-aware, community-driven, and supported by fair governance and funding. The MetaDocencia case shows how collaborative contextualization, equitable workflows, and regional networks can redistribute epistemic power and make science more inclusive and impactful."

    title: "Generative AI poses ethical challenges for open science"
    summary: "Generative AI challenges the ethical foundations of Open Science by exploiting openly shared research outputs to train potentially harmful models. This paper calls for new governance mechanisms to ensure that open data and resources are used responsibly, preserving equity and the common good in scientific knowledge production."

    title: "MetaDocencia: Teaching Statistics And Data Science Online"
    summary: "Teaching and learning are activities that require specific skills. People with training in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics who teach statistics and related disciplines often lack adequate pedagogical training during their training. This situation worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among teachers from less favored countries. MetaDocencia is an interdisciplinary teaching community that seeks to support Spanish-speaking teachers by promoting concrete, evidence-based, student-centered teaching methods. In 26 months we developed five courses with open licenses and gave 81 free editions of these courses reaching 1,163 teachers from 30 countries. People who passed through our courses express high satisfaction (Net Promoter Score &gt; 80%) and find them practical, useful and novel (97% indicated they learned something new)."
