## The problem
The research communities in Latin America face exclusionary systems of research evaluation. These systems privilege English-language and elite norms, constraining the possibilities of Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking researchers, research groups, and networks to actively shape and participate in global scholarly communication.

## The solution
This project offers unique opportunities for Latin American researchers to help them lead a transformation in how research is evaluated. It will build regionally adapted training in open tools for scholarly preprint and dataset review, enable active participation in shaping open infrastructure, provide mentoring and financial support to build local capacity, and foster connections among individuals and groups with shared objectives. By strengthening engagement and driving innovation in the region, the project reinforces qualities critical to research aligned with the [UN Sustainable Development Goals](http://sdgs.un.org/goals) and promotes epistemic justice in research globally.

## Why joining forces
This project builds on [PREreview](https://prereview.org/)â€™s proven record in global peer-review training and facilitation. The approach aligns with [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/)'s expertise in open science training and commitment to lowering barriers to participation in Latin America. Both partners have successfully fostered community-centered initiatives and are rooted in community-developed principles of openness, equity, inclusion, and shared responsibility.

## The work
By contextualizing tools and training, validating non-English knowledge, and supporting historically underserved communities, the project would help Latin American researchers engage more fully in global scientific dialogues and contribute their perspectives to pressing global challenges.
This collaboration between PREreview and MetaDocencia would include three key interventions: 
1. Research and community-informed adaptation, led by MetaDocencia, of the PREreview [Champions Program](https://content.prereview.org/tag/prereview-champion) for Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking Latin America.
2. Delivery of a series of training opportunities to use and contribute to the development of open infrastructure that supports equitable participation in open science, particularly for open preprint and dataset review.
3. Establishment of a community of Champions to support them in becoming local multipliers, providing mentoring and financial support.

## Expected impact
Historically, nearly half (283) of all requests for review submitted to PREreview have been in Portuguese or Spanish. As of September 2025, PREreview has completed 5 reviews in Latin American Spanish and 14 in Brazilian Portuguese, and its website, workflows, and several resources [have been translated](https://content.prereview.org/celebrating-our-localization-and-translation-milestone/) in 2025. Additionally, MetaDocencia serves an active community with over 1,000 members on Slack, primarily in Latin America, and over 20 fellow communities involved in education and research, with an even broader reach through social media. These facts highlight a growing need and existing engagement in the region, which this project aims to further amplify and support. 
Based on proven track records, the outputs from this collaboration promise to be impactful. PREreview has facilitated ethical peer review training reaching more than 800 researchers across 49 countries. MetaDocencia has delivered 94 [training](https://github.com/MetaDocencia/reportes-publicos/tree/main/MD-workshops-cursos) courses to over 1,500 participants from 33 countries, achieving an excellent [Net Promoter Score](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/customer/net-promoter-score/#:~:text=An%20NPS%20score%20measures%20customer,a%20higher%20score%20is%20desirable.) of 89%. Both MetaDocencia and PREreview have a strong record in community-centered training, the [collaboratively contextualization](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/post/2024/20240820-collab-contextualization/) of resources, and the development of open, human-centered infrastructure that supports equitable participation in open science.
Measures of impact of this project would include:
* Number of research groups and networks onboarded by MetaDocencia, with over 20 groups expected per year.
* Number of preprints and dataset reviews posted on PREreview from the region. The increased engagement and contribution to open peer review practices should double current numbers.
* Increased engagement in global scientific dialogues and contribution of Latin American perspectives, evidenced by the nature and scope of open reviews and discussions, and hopefully by a positive shift in leadership and influence within the open science ecosystem.
