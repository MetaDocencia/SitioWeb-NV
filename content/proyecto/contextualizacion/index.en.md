## The problem
Researchers in many Global South countries face challenges and injustices when applying the principles of Open Science. Language barriers limit the free exchange of knowledge, which is particularly visible in Latin America. The predominance of English in science excludes valuable contributions from those who are not comfortable communicating in this language, widening the gap in the global distribution of knowledge and recognition in science.

## The approach
Contextualization is one of the areas that supports the work of MetaDocencia. Its main goal is to develop high-quality resources in Spanish based on contents originally published in other languages. Quality involves not only an accurate translation, but also its adaptation to the local context in an accessible and meaningful way. The method and consensus reached in each open project are also shared for the benefit of others. Contextualization also works on improving the visibility of materials originally in Spanish within English-speaking communities.

## About
The contextualization of resources puts into practice MetaDocencia's core values like diversity, autonomy and versatility to bring a Latin American perspective that strengthens and supports Spanish-speaking communities.

## Model and Impact
MetaDocencia formally embraced contextualization with the specific task of adapting the original NASA TOPS Open Science materials. MetaDocencia organized a community-wide reflection on how to best approach building knowledge in Spanish this way. The conversation went beyond language itself, encompassing the definition of the text’s purpose and framing its communicational meaning.
The community-driven agreements guided the adaptation of NASA’s Open Science content so that it can represent Latin American identity. A total of 87,493 words were contextualized into Spanish by the coordinated work of 22 people for more than six weeks.
MetaDocencia also undertakes other projects where accessibility of content in Spanish is key. For example, as part of its consultancy services, MetaDocencia has contextualized several calls and related support materials originally published in English by Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI).
