We organize participatory spaces for dialogues that foster learning and the exchange of experiences, strengthening collaboration networks and shared knowledge.

## Open Science
Our community showed interest in deepening the discussions that began during our group meetings to study the contents of the initial version of NASA TOPS Open Science 101. In response to this interest, in March 2024, we organized a series of online conversations to reflect on various topics related to Open Science. Together, we sought to understand how we learn Open Science, how we apply it, and what implications it has for our region. We also aimed to acknowledge those dimensions of Open Science that cause discomfort from a Latin American perspective and reflect on them. In short, we sought to recognize its advantages and potential by debating its scope and possibilities.

## Governance
During the second half of 2022, we began work on redesigning our governance. Our goal was to collaboratively design a transparent model for strategic decision-making that would enable us to strengthen our institutional mission on the basis of community building. This purpose brought us together in a collective learning process, for which we created a cycle of 8 open, virtual, synchronous meetings, with invited speakers who shared their experiences on various aspects of governance in public and private institutions. In addition, we held numerous team meetings to envision, explore, and consider new forms of organization and models for managing spaces in open education and knowledge, while advancing the presentation, processing, and shaping of the institutional documents that now constitute MetaDocencia’s Governance.

## Reading Club on Teaching Tech Together
We learn better when we learn in community.
In 2022, we organized and coordinated a reading club on the book Teaching Tech Together. Greg Wilson’s work brings together many of the teaching concepts and practices we use and promote at MetaDocencia.
Through 8 open, free, online meetings, we came together to analyze the content and build new collective learnings.
