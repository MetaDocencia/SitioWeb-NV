## The problem
Individuals and organizations actively promoting Open Science in Latin America face challenges due to geographic isolation, disconnection, and low visibility. These include limited access to collaborations, infrastructure, training and sustainability.

## The proposal
This project was launched in early 2023 to centralize information about resources, events, and funding opportunities related to Open Science in the region. It consists of an interactive application developed with the Shiny package of the R programming language to facilitate access to information useful for Open Science communities in Latin America.

The goals of this project are to:
* Promote collaboration and networking among researchers, institutions, and organizations across different disciplines.
* Showcase Latin American scientific contributions, increasing visibility and recognition of achievements in the region.
* Facilitate access to a curated collection of funding databases, open-access journals, data repositories,  educational materials and more
* Empower early-career researchers by providing resources and dedicated mentoring programs to support their development in line with Open Science best practices.
