### The Problem
Researchers in low- and middle-income countries, such as most in Latin America, often face greater challenges in securing international funding than those in high-income countries. Language barriers, cultural differences, and limited training in competitive grant proposal writing widen the gap with funding entities. As a result, research funders do not support as many proposals from low- and middle-income countries as they would like, despite being willing to work with diverse research communities in an inclusive and well-intentioned manner.

### The Strategy
This project aims to provide persons from Latin America conducting research in Spanish with access to a safe and collaborative peer community where knowledge, contacts, and high-quality advice are freely shared by mentors with a proven track record of securing funding. This support will help increase participation and improve the chances of success in pursuing international funding.

#### Why MetaDocencia
MetaDocencia promotes equitable science and research. The development of this project began in 2023, when MetaDocencia recognized the need to democratize knowledge about fundraising within the Spanish-speaking research community in Latin America as an essential step toward advancing equity. Members of MetaDocencia, along with representatives from CZI Open Science, OLS, and other stakeholders, met in person at the [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) [DISC Unconference 2023](https://numfocus.medium.com/disc-unconference-2023-designing-inclusivity-in-open-source-14019cbdb3cb) and co-created an [initial curriculum](https://github.com/MetaDocencia/AccesoFinanciacion/blob/main/hidden-curriculum.md).

### The Plan 
This project aims to iteratively develop a curriculum that combines both traditional and tacit knowledge necessary for successful research fundraising. The insights, experiences, and feedback of course participants will guide improvements for future editions. The goal is to collaborate with inclusive funders to adapt course activities to their specific application requirements.

This curriculum will be taught in short, participatory, and free courses. Depending on need and available funding, it will be offered in full or abbreviated versions, both for Spanish-speaking researchers in Latin America and adapted for individuals working in research administration and management in academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and grassroots groups, among others.
The course content will be complemented by support materials designed to teach others how to deliver this curriculum, multiplying its reach and dissemination speed.
In parallel, MetaDocencia will build and lead a supportive and inclusive community of practice so that researchers feel safe sharing information and helping one another in fundraising efforts, fostering a mindset of abundance rather than competition.
The project will be accompanied by a longitudinal follow-up study to measure the success rate in securing funds after participation, assessing its medium-term impact.
