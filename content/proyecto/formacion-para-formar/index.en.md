## The Problem
Many people interested in teaching have never received training on how to do it effectively. This includes professionals with deep expertise in their field who need to improve the design, preparation, and delivery of their classes.

## How to Approach It
MetaDocencia’s Train the Trainer program addresses the demand for practical pedagogical skills among Spanish-speaking communities dedicated to science and technology.

## About us
This course aligns with MetaDocencia’s mission and track record by strengthening teaching capacities with open and accessible resources. MetaDocencia works regularly and directly with persons from Latin American communities and partners with organizations worldwide for extended institutional support.

## What we do
This course is offered online over 6 weeks with one weekly, synchronous class. It is also available in an in-person format across 2 consecutive days.
It combines theory and practice sessions on course design and teaching, from audience definition to expected outcomes, covering learning theory, memory, cognitive load, types of assessment, follow-up and feedback techniques, etc.
It promotes active participation from everyone through group teaching demos, self-assessment exercises, regular breaks, and a follow-up virtual meeting to demonstrate learned skills and complete certification. All course materials are openly licensed, and guidance is provided on how to reuse them.
This Train the Trainer program is informed by and connected to similar open initiatives such as [The Carpentries Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/index.html) and the Train the Trainer courses from [ELIXIR-GOBLET](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/training/train-the-trainer) and [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/trainer-support/expand-your-training-skills). Many concepts also draw from Greg Wilson’s foundational book [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/es/). At times, MetaDocencia collaborates with organizations like CABANA to organize and facilitate the workshop.
