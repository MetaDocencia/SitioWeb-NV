## The Problem
The adoption of Open Science in Spanish-speaking communities faces obstacles such as the scarcity of materials adapted to the local context and opportunities for training and peer-learning.

## The Solution
We provide training, in Spanish and contextualized for Latin America, to reduce knowledge gaps and facilitate the practical application of Open Science principles and tools by those engaged in research, teaching, communication, data, and software.

## Why MetaDocencia
Open Science serves our mission to build scientific and technical capacities with a local perspective through networks, learning spaces, and accessible resources. Training in Spanish with a local lens has been a key element of our proven strategy.

## The Working Model
We have over five years of experience training the Latin American community in both soft skills and technical knowledge aligned with Open Science.
A key milestone was the  Spanish contextualization of NASA Open Science content, followed by its adaptation into free, synchronous, six-week online cohorts with active lessons, peer-to-peer discussions, presentations of local initiatives, and dual certification (NASA + MetaDocencia).
